# Code of Conduct
## Introduction
Welcome to the Droplink project. This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the community, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all, and expect our code of conduct to be honored by everyone who participates in the Droplink community.
## Our Standards
### Be Respectful
Respectful communication is the foundation of a productive community. All contributors should engage in considerate dialogue and refrain from abusive or aggressive behavior.
### Be Inclusive
We welcome participants from all backgrounds and experiences. Diversity contributes to a stronger community, and we are committed to providing an accessible environment for everyone.
### Be Accountable
Participants are responsible for their own actions and must ensure they adhere to community standards. Constructive feedback is encouraged, but it should be given with empathy and respect.
## Unacceptable Behavior
Harassment, discrimination, and exclusionary behavior will not be tolerated. This includes any language or action that fosters a hostile environment based on race, gender, sexuality, disability, or any other attribute.
## Reporting and Enforcement
If you witness or experience any conduct that violates this code, please report it to the project maintainers. We take all reports seriously and will respond appropriately to each case to maintain the community's integrity.
## Conclusion
The Droplink community aspires to develop a friendly, inclusive, and respectful environment for all participants. We are grateful to our community members for their dedication to upholding these values in all interactions and projects.
